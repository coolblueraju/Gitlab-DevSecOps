You are a DevSecOps engineer and you have been tasked to write a YAML file that defines a GitLab DevSecOps pipeline with three stages: "build", "test" and "scascan". Also, Snyk should fail the build if security vulnerabilities are identified.



1) The "build" stage should have one job called "build-app", which runs the script "mvn clean package".

2) The "test" stage should have one job called "test-app", which runs the script "mvn clean test".

3) The "scascan" stage should have one job called "sca-scan-app", which runs the Snyk SCA scan. Use the below values for integrating Snyk in DevSecOps pipeline:
